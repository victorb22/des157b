    <h1>Observations & Questions</h1>

    <h2>1. Flipping through secctions</h2>
    <p>- Although I couldn't participate in usability testing, I have done some of my own and with other people and heard their thoughts.</p>
    <p>I had my brother test and one issue he encountered was that the changing background images and styles kept changing during hiding and displaying sections. I have started working on this and basically have it working now, I just have to make sure I am hiding and displaying the proper features and content.</p>

    <h2>2. Future Page more futuristic</h2>
    <p>- Another comment and feedback I was actively searching for was on how to make my future page look more futuristic. One suggestion I received was updating the NYTimes website by adding a news ticker. I have already added this, I thought it was a great idea since it doesn't exist on the site right now. I just have to style it the way I want now.</p>

    <h2>3. Dropdown Selections</h2>
    <p>- I also heard that the instructions on what to do on the site aren't lcear so I am thinking of including an overlay with an instructions button maybe. I think this is one thing I need to think about more, I want my navigation to be clear so I'll have to brainstorm wording and what I want said.</p>
